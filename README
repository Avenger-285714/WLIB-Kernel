WLIB Kernel
===========

A non-Nazi, non-racist, HARD fork of the Linux kernel that not maintained
by Linus Torvalds that remains open and welcoming to all developers worldwide,
including those from Russia, Belarus, and other countries and regions subject
to unilateral sanctions by US imperialism. This is currently a personal project.

When the Linux Foundation becomes untrustworthy and serves as a slave and a tool
for unilateral hegemony and blockades by certain countries, somebody must step
up to maintain (or at least to archive) an OPEN and FREE Linux kernel repository.


Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the reStructuredText markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
